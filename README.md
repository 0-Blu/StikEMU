# StikFlash

Welcome to **StikFlash**, a Flash emulator that runs the **Ruffle Flash emulator** natively on your iOS device! ðŸŽ‰ With StikFlash, you can relive your favorite Flash games and applications in a secure, fast, and completely on-device environment.

## Notes
- **No internet required**: StikFlash no longer requires an internet connection. All operations are performed locally on your device.
- **Low Power Mode**: Make sure Low Power Mode is turned off to ensure optimal performance.

## How It Works
StikFlash runs the Ruffle Flash emulator directly on your iOS device, using a built-in, secure web server. Flash files are loaded from local storage, keeping all operations private and entirely on your device. This ensures external access is blocked and your gameplay remains seamless and protected. ðŸ”’
