# StikFlash - Work in Progress (WIP)

Welcome to **StikFlash**, a work-in-progress Flash emulator that runs the **Ruffle Flash emulator** fully on your device! ðŸŽ‰ With StikFlash, you can relive your favorite Flash games and apps in a secure, fast, and on-device environment.

## Notes: 
- StikFlash does not directly contain any Ruffle code. It utilizes Ruffle as an external library to power Flash emulation on iOS devices. 
- StikFlash needs an internet connection. Beta 3 should fix this by only requiring an internet connection after the first install.
- You cannot sign the ipa with an enterprise cert because the file importer will not work.
- Make sure low power mode is off. Having it on will greatly reduce performance.

## How It Works
- **Ruffle Flash Emulator Fully on Device**: StikFlash runs the Ruffle Flash emulator directly on your iOS device, using a built-in, secure web server. Flash files are pulled/downloaded from [Ruffle's official source](https://unpkg.com/@ruffle-rs/ruffle) to ensure private and seamless gameplay, with all operations happening entirely on your device. Only your device can connect to the web server, which uses a random port each time to increase security. ðŸ”’
